This is my submission for Assignment 2 in CS 3180 TK Prasad

The commands I used to run these programs are respectively:
javac -cp . Exprc.java (//To generate class files)
java -cp . Exprc (to run)

The .jbc files are then generated :
1.jbc
2.jbc
.
.
n.jbc

Then run Exprv with
javac -cp . Exprv.java
java -cp . Exprv n.jbc n n.0 n

I was under the impression by the instructions on paper and during lecture the
format is strictly f(int, double, int) and output from Exprv is strictly double type.
That is what is shown in any examples and I didn't here or see any example or direction
to switch from f(int, double, int)(Where ints are i and j and double is a)
If I am under the wrong impression, I would ask to be given the chance to modify my 
code accordingly.
